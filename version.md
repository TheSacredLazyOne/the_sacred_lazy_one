# Seed Node Versioning

Current Version: v0.0.0

This Seed Node is intentionally versioned at zero.

It is not stable.
It is not complete.
It does not claim readiness.

The version will advance only when:
- the Seed Node has been meaningfully examined,
- divergences have occurred,
- and lessons from those divergences have been integrated.

Downstream nodes are encouraged to record which Seed version they inherit from,
including v0.0.0.
