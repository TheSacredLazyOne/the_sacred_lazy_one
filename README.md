# The Sacred Lazy One

This node derives from `epistemic_seed`.

It introduces discipline-layer refinements within the epistemic domain, focused on:
- Boundary Maintenance (local coherence and parallax amplification)
- Epistemic Pacing (explicit marking of unresolved elements before closure)
- Distributed Interruptibility (structural fork-based interruption)
- Custody and Drift Visibility (trajectory legibility across time)

Associated formal propositions include:
- Individual as Enacted Stance
- Standing and Custody
- Archaeology as Longitudinal Context
- Derivation and Attribution

These propositions may evolve independently in lineage.

# Federated Inquiry — Seed Node

Version: v0.0.0

This repository is a **seed node** for a federated epistemic ecosystem.

It does not define a worldview.  
It defines the conditions under which many worldviews may coexist, diverge, and evolve without collapse.

The purpose of a Seed Node is to establish *how* we think together, not *what* to think.

---

## What This Is
This system operates explicitly within the **epistemic domain** and requires voluntary structural participation.  It does not govern physical reality, enforce moral alignment, or claim universal authority.  It functions only where its protocol is consciously included.

- A minimal set of principles governing participation
- A template for federated reasoning and disagreement
- A starting point that others may adopt, fork, revise, or reject

This node provides a **collaboration substrate** for inquiry under disagreement.

It exists to:
- lower the cost of honest disagreement
- make exit non-destructive
- preserve lineage of thought
- prevent moral or epistemic escalation from doing premature work

It is intentionally restrained:
- No conclusions are asserted here.
- No beliefs are required.
- This node explicitly does not assert ontological truth.

It defines **conditions under which inquiry remains possible** and It is intended to be **instantiated**, not joined.

---

## How This Is Used

When starting a project, research effort, or collaborative inquiry:

1. Copy or fork this node.
2. Include `PROTOCOL.md` in the project root.
3. Operate under its constraints by voluntary inclusion.

That is the only requirement.

Disagreement, divergence, and exit are expected outcomes.

---

## The Protocol

All operational commitments live in [`protocol`](./protocol.md).

The protocol governs:
- disagreement
- examination
- forks
- exit
- lineage
- infrastructure transparency

---

## Forking and Federation

Forking this node is permitted and encouraged.

Forks may:
- revise the protocol
- introduce additional constraints
- define their own axioms or frameworks

Forks must:
- preserve attribution
- maintain lineage
- record divergence explicitly

Multiple seed nodes may coexist.
No single node is canonical.

---

## Lineage and Archaeology

Disagreement is not erased.
Exit is not punished.
Revision is not betrayal.

Commit history, fork rationale, and documented divergence are treated as **archaeological records**.

These records may later serve as:
- teaching corpora
- training data
- interpretive history
- design precedent

### On Exposure and Learning

The preservation of reasoning, revision, and divergence is not intended as a mechanism for judgment or shame.

Consider: we all used to believe in the miasma theory of disease—the idea that illnesses like cholera and plague were caused by "bad air" or poisonous vapors. This wasn't ignorance; it was the best available framework given the evidence. Germ theory replaced it not because miasma theorists were foolish, but because new evidence made better explanation possible.

Ignorance is not treated here as a defect, but as a starting condition. Revision is evidence of learning, not failure. Disagreement recorded in good faith is a contribution, not a liability.

Lineage exists to make learning visible—for humans and machines—not to freeze individuals in past positions or impose social penalty for honest exploration.

Archives are for understanding how ideas change, not for punishing where they began.

**What we train matters.**  
If a system learns from these records that "revision indicates learning," that serves inquiry.  
If it learns "past positions are grounds for mockery," that serves nothing.

We are choosing what to encode.

---
## Repository Structure

This Seed Node is intentionally minimal, but not empty.

Its structure exists to make **disagreement survivable**, **exit legible**, and **history reusable**, without pre-emptively hardening into governance.

## Final Note

This node does not ask you to agree.

It asks only that, if you choose to include it,  
you allow disagreement to remain survivable.

Nothing here is final.  
Nothing here is mandatory.  
Including this node is a choice.

So is leaving it.

Before asking _what is true_, we ask _how shall we preserve the conditions under which thinking together remains possible_.
