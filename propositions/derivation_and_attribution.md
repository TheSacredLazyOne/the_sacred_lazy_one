# Proposition: Derivation and Attribution

## Claim

When a framework is instantiated as a node, attribution follows from the method of derivation.

Derivation determines standing in lineage.

---

## Types of Derivation

### 1. Collaborative Derivation

A node is collaborative when the framework’s custodian participates in its creation.

Attribution may reference:
- the individual as enacted stance
- the shared method of construction

Custody is shared and recorded in lineage.

---

### 2. Derivative Derivation

A node is derivative when it is created unilaterally from reading, interpreting, or extending another framework.

Attribution references:
- the source node
- the source commit or version
- the interpretive method used

A derivative node records how a framework appears from within this epistemic field.

It does not represent the custodian’s stance.

---

## Archaeological Invariant

The distinction between collaborative and derivative derivation remains legible in lineage.

It may not be retroactively collapsed.

A derivative node may later transition to collaborative status only through explicit participation of the source custodian, recorded as a new derivation event.

---

## Structural Notes
- Derivation does not imply endorsement.
- Derivative nodes do not claim custodial authority; the invite shared custody.
- Lineage preserves method of emergence.
