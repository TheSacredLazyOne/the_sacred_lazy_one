# Proposition: Standing and Custody

## Claim

Standing arises from traceable entanglement within a trajectory.

Standing strengthens in proportion to demonstrable participation in, or exposure to, the outcomes of a stance.

## Structure

Standing emerges from:
- enacted participation
- exposure to material or epistemic consequence
- traceable contribution to the trajectory under examination

Custody refers to the obligation to maintain visibility of trajectory once enacted.

Custody preserves trace.
