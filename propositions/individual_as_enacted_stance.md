# Proposition: Individual as Enacted Stance

## Claim

Within Radical Pluralism, an **individual** is the locus where stance becomes enacted and traceable within a relational field.

An individual is a visible position maintained across time through trace.

## Structure

Individuality consists of:

- an enacted stance
- a trajectory that can be examined longitudinally
- custodial participation in lineage

Continuity is preserved through trace.

Revision does not negate individuality; it demonstrates it.

## Domain

This definition operates within the epistemic layer established by voluntary inclusion of the protocol.
