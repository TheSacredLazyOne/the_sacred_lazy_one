# Proposition: Archaeology as Longitudinal Context

## Claim

Archaeology preserves longitudinal trajectory.

It maintains continuity of stance across time.

## Structure

Archaeology:
- records revision history
- preserves contextual linkage between claims
- evaluates patterns rather than isolated moments
- requires temporal continuity for authoritative interpretation

A stance cannot be represented in isolation from its recorded trajectory.
