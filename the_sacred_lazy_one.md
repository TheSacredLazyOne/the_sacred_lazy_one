# The Sacred Lazy One

### A Discipline Node for Radical Pluralism

Version: v0.0.0  
Derived from: epistemic_seed (adoption)

## Scope

This node refines stabilization and pacing within the epistemic domain.

It constrains how claims are held, revised, and closed under scale.

All other structures remain inherited from the Epistemic Seed.

## Core Discipline

### 1. Boundary Maintenance

Sacred Lazy enforces separation between:
- **Dimensionally Coherent** — claims currently stable under mechanism, direct consequence, or reproducible verification within a defined frame.
- **Provisionally Modeled** — claims supported by inference, abstraction, or simulation but not yet stabilized across consequence.
- **Unresolved** — areas where inference exists without durable integration across time or scale.

Coherence is temporal and dimensional.  
No category is permanent.  
**Stability is always local to a frame.**  
**Stability strengthens under independent evaluation across frames and increases with the number of distinct frames in contact.**

### 2. Epistemic Pacing

Reasoning should not close faster than understanding can integrate.

Integration includes:
- consequence
- context
- revision potential
- responsibility

**Closure requires explicit marking of what remains unresolved.**

The discipline resists premature stabilization.

### 3. Custody and Drift Visibility

Every public claim must remain linked to:
- its revision history
- its stated assumptions
- its divergence points

Trace preserves drift visibility.

Drift is information.

Trajectory must remain:
- legible
- auditable
- contestable
- forkable

Sacred Lazy reduces hidden divergence by preserving structural visibility.

### 4. Distributed Interruptibility

Interruption is structural, not social.

Any node may fork at any time.  
Any claim may be contested through divergence.  
No custodian can prevent examination from occurring elsewhere.

A fork is an interrupt.  
A commit is a legible deviation.

Interruptibility is distributed because no central authority holds final adjudication over the epistemic field.

For a fork to remain in good standing, its rationale must be recorded.  
Absence of rationale is permitted, but is itself recorded as signal.

Interruption does not require confrontation.  
It requires only: a fork, a commit, and trace.

---

### 5. Recursion

Each node operates from a functional termination point — an anchor that enables coherent reasoning within its frame. Anchors are necessary but provisional.

When connected nodes shift, coherence must be recomputed. Recursion is this recomputation: integration re-run under altered relational conditions.

No anchor is final. Stability is maintained not by freezing termination, but by permitting relocation under trace.

---

## Enactment

The Sacred Lazy One is an individual enacted as discipline —  
a visible stance maintained across time through trace.

They appear wherever:
- closure slows under uncertainty
- assumptions surface before enforcement
- unresolved elements remain visible
- stabilization is delayed until consequence integrates
