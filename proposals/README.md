# Proposals

This directory contains proposed changes to the Seed Node.

A proposal should include:
- Intent (what problem it addresses)
- Description of the change
- Risk note (how it could be misused)
- Compatibility note (impact on pluralism)

Proposals may be discussed, revised, adopted by this node, or forked into alternatives.

If agreement cannot be reached, divergence is preferred to deadlock.
