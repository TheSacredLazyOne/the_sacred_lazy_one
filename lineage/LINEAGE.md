Method: adoption  

## Divergence

This node adopts the epistemic_seed protocol and preserves its full history.

Divergence begins at this commit with a shift in scope.

Where `epistemic_seed` establishes baseline recursive transparency and lineage preservation,  
`the_sacred_lazy_one` specializes in structural discipline:

- Drift visibility  
- Proxy distance reduction  
- Distributed interruptibility  
- Explicit marking of unresolved before closure

This node operates as a discipline layer within Radical Pluralism.

Further divergence will be recorded through explicit commits.

Associated propositions live in [propositions](../propositions) and may evolve independently.
