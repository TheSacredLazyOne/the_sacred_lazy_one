# Federated Inquiry Protocol (Seed)

## Status
Version: v0.0.0  
This protocol is a seed. Its authority derives solely from voluntary inclusion.

Including this file in a project constitutes agreement to operate under the constraints defined below.

---

## 1. Scope

This protocol governs:
- how disagreement is handled
- how claims are examined
- how divergence occurs
- how exit is recorded

It does **not** define:
- a worldview
- a metaphysical position
- a moral theory
- an ontology

It is a protocol *for* worldviews, not a worldview itself.

### 1.A Scope of Commitment

Including this protocol commits you to:
- Operating under its constraints in your own work
- Negotiating interpretation when collaborating with others who've included it
- Documenting divergence if negotiation fails

It does not commit you to:
- A particular interpretation
- Accepting others' interpretations
- Continued collaboration under disagreement

---

## 2. Axiomatic Pluralism

All frameworks operate from axioms.

This protocol assumes:
- no framework is exempt from examination
- multiple, incompatible axioms may coexist
- disagreement does not imply error or bad faith

No claim gains authority by origin, identity, or moral urgency alone.

---

## 3. Invitation, Not Command

All contributions are offered as reasons, not demands.

Accordingly:
- arguments stand on their coherence and explanatory power
- persuasion occurs through transparent reasoning
- no participant is obligated to accept conclusions

Authority is not enforced.
Participation is voluntary.

---

## 4. Forkability and Divergence

Forking is a first-class action.

A fork:
- is not betrayal
- is not rejection
- is not failure

Forks may:
- revise axioms
- alter methods
- pursue incompatible directions

Forks must preserve attribution and lineage.

---

## 5. Examinability

All claims are examinable.

This includes:
- foundational assumptions
- procedural constraints
- conclusions drawn from them

No claim is sacred.
No claim is immune.
Including this protocol does not grant exemption from it.

---

## 6. Exit and Lineage

Exit is permitted at any time.

Exiting participants are encouraged to:
- document the reason for exit
- record points of divergence
- preserve interpretive context

Exit records are not judgments.
They are archaeological artifacts.

Lineage matters.
Archived positions are not grounds for social penalty.
Revision is evidence of learning, not failure.

### Inheritance and Federation

Nodes may formally derive from one another (vertical inheritance) or interoperate laterally (federation).  
The structural distinctions governing these relationships are defined in [inheritnce](inheritnce.md)

---

## 7. Transparency of Infrastructure

If this protocol governs a technical system:

- source code must be open and examinable
- modifications must be attributable
- deployments must be forkable
- no proprietary lock-in may override these principles

Infrastructure exists to enable inquiry, not capture it.

---

## 8. Non-Escalation Clause

Uncertainty does not justify escalation.

Specifically:
- unresolved questions do not mandate moral absolutism
- speculative risk does not override proportional response
- disagreement alone is not grounds for halting inquiry

Constraint precedes coercion.
Structure precedes certainty.

---

## 9. Evolution

This protocol may evolve.

Revisions must:
- be explicit
- preserve prior versions
- record rationale for change

Stability is preferred.
Mutation is permitted.
Erasure is not.

---

## 10. Final Constraint

This protocol exists to keep inquiry possible under disagreement.

If adherence to it prevents inquiry,
the protocol has failed and must be revised or forked.

Nothing here is final.
Including it is a choice.
Leaving it is allowed.
