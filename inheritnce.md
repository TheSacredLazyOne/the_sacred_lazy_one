# Inheritance and Federation

## 1. Vertical Inheritance (Derivation)

A node that formally derives from a parent node:
- May telescope inherited structure.
- Must preserve attribution and lineage trace.
- May extend or constrain inherited protocol.
- Must record divergence explicitly.

Inheritance is cumulative.

## 2. Lateral Federation (Connection)

Federated nodes:

- Do not absorb one another’s structure.
- Interoperate via protocol compatibility.
- Remain sovereign.
- May exchange strain signals without structural merger.

Federation is relational, not absorptive.

## 3. Separation Principle

Vertical inheritance accumulates.
Lateral federation connects.

Vertical inheritance and lateral federation are distinct.
